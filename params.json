I'm currently playing with the protocol only in Node.js, attempting to get the xlogo demo app communicating successfully. One this has been completed I will start to explore more of the X protocol and port the Node.js code (which uses Buffers extensively) to browser compatible code and attempt to use HTML5 to render the visuals (communicating via WebSockets)!\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nThe project may eventually have both server and client side X processing, allowing for optimisation of the X protocol and compression of Pixmaps before transferring to the client allowing for lightweight remote desktop connections in a web browser.\r\n","name":"Javascript x server","google":""}
